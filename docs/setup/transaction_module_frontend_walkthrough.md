# Transaction Module (Frontend) Walkthrough

I have successfully implemented the Frontend for the Transaction Modules, fully integrating it with the Backend APIs.

## 1. Master Data UI
-   **Contacts** (`/contacts`): Tabbed interface for managing Customers and Vendors.
-   **Products** (`/products`): Interface for managing Products, including the critical `Sales Account` and `Expense Account` mapping.

## 2. Sales Module UI
-   **List View** (`/sales`): Displays invoices with status badges (DRAFT, POSTED, PAID).
-   **Create Invoice** (`/sales/create`): Dynamic form allowing multiple line items. Auto-calculates totals.
-   **Invoice Detail & Approval** (`/sales/[id]`): View invoice details. Includes an **"Approve & Post"** button for DRAFT invoices, which triggers the backend auto-journaling and displays the link to the generated journal entry.

## 3. Purchase Module UI
-   **List View** (`/purchase`): Displays bills.
-   **Create Bill** (`/purchase/create`): Dynamic form for recording expenses/bills.
-   **Bill Detail & Approval** (`/purchase/[id]`): View bill details with approval functionality.

## 4. Payment Module UI
-   **List View** (`/payments`): Displays history of receipts and payments.
-   **Create Payment** (`Modal`): Allows recording `RECEIPT` (Money In) or `PAYMENT` (Money Out), linking to specific Cash/Bank accounts.

## 5. Navigation
-   Updated `Dashboard Layout` sidebar to include new sections:
    -   **Transactions**: Sales, Purchases, Payments.
    -   **Master Data**: Contacts, Products.

## Next Steps
-   **Testing**: End-to-end testing of the full cycle (Create Product -> Create Invoice -> Approve -> Pay -> Check Reports).
-   **Reporting**: Enhance the Reports module to fully utilize the data generated by these transactions.
